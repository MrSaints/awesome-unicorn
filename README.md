Awesome Unicorn
===============

Yet another curated list of anything and everything; mostly for web unicorns. Jack of all trades, master of none.


Why aren't you using awesome markdown?
--------------------------------------

Storing my bookmarks in a data format such as YAML or JSON provides me with greater flexibility. I can defer the presentation for another time among many other benefits:

- Create different templates (I could even generate a markdown version of it)
- Create automated tests (to remove deadlinks)
- Ease sorting / filtering / searching

Essentially, I am using this as my web design / development bookmark manager and what I intend on creating is a simple boilerplate for that.

In the future, it should be easy to write tools to import / export bookmarks (e.g. a Chrome extension) while leveraging on Git version control.


Why Jekyll?
-----------

It is supported by Github Pages. Due to the aforementioned flexibility, I can easily switch to another static site generator in the future.


How are you categorising bookmarks?
-----------------------------------

Mostly intuition, but with a hint of conscious reasoning at times.

There are many bookmarks that fall in several categories. The very art of being a _web unicorn_ entails the breaking down of these classifications / boundaries and a recognition of the benefits of an interdisplinary approach.

I guess you can say it is pretty ironic for me to do the exact opposite of the above, but it is a trade-off I am making for the purpose of organisation.
