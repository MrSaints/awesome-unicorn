Awesome Unicorn [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MrSaints/awesome-unicorn.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.org/MrSaints/awesome-unicorn)
===============

Yet another curated list of anything and everything; mostly for web unicorns - Jack of all trades, master of none.

# About

## Why aren't you using awesome markdown?

Storing my bookmarks in a data format such as YAML or JSON provides me with greater flexibility. I can defer the presentation for another time among many other benefits:

- Create different templates (I could even generate a markdown version of it)
- [Create automated tests (to remove deadlinks)](https://travis-ci.org/MrSaints/awesome-unicorn)
- [Ease sorting / filtering / searching](https://github.com/MrSaints/awesome-unicorn/blob/gh-pages/index.html)
- Management tools (e.g. autogenerate metadata and thumbnails; archiving)

Essentially, I am using this as my web design / development bookmark manager and what I intend on creating is a simple boilerplate for that. It is hence, part of a much larger project.

In the future, it should be easy to write tools to import / export bookmarks (e.g. a Chrome extension) while leveraging on Git version control.


## Why Jekyll?

It is supported by Github Pages. Due to the aforementioned flexibility, I can easily switch to another static site generator in the future.


## How are you categorising bookmarks?

Mostly intuition, but with a hint of conscious reasoning at times.

There are many bookmarks that fall in several categories. The very art of being a _web unicorn_ entails the breaking down of these classifications / boundaries and a recognition of the benefits of an interdisplinary approach.

I guess you can say it is pretty ironic for me to do the exact opposite of the above, but it is a trade-off I am making for the purpose of organisation.


## Why are you collecting these bookmarks?

I am a hoarder, on the computer. There may also come a time when I need to look for a certain bookmark.


# TODOs

- [ ] Extension (record frequency)
- [ ] Better UI
- [ ] Notes (e.g. rationale, summary)
- [ ] Tags (e.g. reference, tool)
- [ ] Other factors (e.g. usefulness rating)
