Awesome Unicorn
---------------

Yet another curated list of anything and everything; mostly for web unicorns. Jack of all trades, master of none.


# Why aren't you using awesome markdown?

Storing my bookmarks in a data format such as YAML or JSON provides me with greater flexibility. I can defer the presentation for another time among many other benefits:

- Create different templates (I could even generate a markdown version of it)
- Create automated tests (to remove deadlinks)
- Ease sorting / filtering / searching

Essentially, I am using this as my web design / development bookmark manager and what I intend on creating is a simple boilerplate for that.
